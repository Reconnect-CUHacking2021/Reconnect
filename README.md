## Description
Reconnect is the perfect platform for connecting store owners to customers in a post-covid world. Ensuring stores are comfortable with thier customers, and still helping those they aren't. We imagine this as a government first app, with information being shared about updates on the pandemic. There are multiple components, here is what's included:

### Client-facing app
This is where consumers interact with our platform. They sign up and then input their vaccination code, which means we can verify if they have gotten their vaccination and stores that are only allowing people inside who are vaccined can go in. This is a great place to find stores, information, and also view your history of interactions with the stores.
